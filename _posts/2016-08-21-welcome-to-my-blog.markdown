Welcome! I have finally made my own website, which is a project I wanted to do for a while. Over time, I hope to gradually upgrade it from its current form to something a bit more exciting. For now, though, simple is sufficient. 

My idea for this blog is to serve as a springboard of ideas throughout my final year at Georgetown and beyond. I hope you enjoy.

Best,

Mathison
